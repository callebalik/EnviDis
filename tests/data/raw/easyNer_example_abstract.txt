Abstract  Background  Medical research generates millions of publications and it is a great challenge for researchers  to utilize this information in full since its scale and complexity greatly surpasses human  reading capabilities. Automated text mining can help extract and connect information spread  across this large body of literature but this technology is not easily accessible to life scientists.  Results  Here, we developed an easy-to-use end-to-end pipeline for deep learning- and dictionarybased named entity recognition (NER) of typical entities found in medical research articles,  including diseases, cells, chemicals, genes/proteins, and species. The pipeline can access and  process large medical research article collections (PubMed, CORD-19) or raw text and  incorporates a series of deep learning models fine-tuned on the HUNER corpora collection. In  addition, the pipeline can perform dictionary-based NER related to COVID-19 and other  medical topics. Users can also load their own NER models and dictionaries to include  additional entities. The output consists of publication-ready ranked lists and graphs of  detected entities and files containing the annotated texts. An associated script allows rapid  inspection of the results for specific entities of interest. As model use cases, the pipeline was  deployed on two collections of autophagy-related abstracts from PubMed and on the CORD19  dataset, a collection of 764 398 research article abstracts related to COVID-19.  Conclusions  The NER pipeline we present is applicable in a variety of medical research settings and makes  customizable text mining accessible to life scientists.
